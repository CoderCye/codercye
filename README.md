### C++ Developer, Front-End (Middle), Back-End(Middle)

I'm an Amateur software developer. Sometimes I do very simple things out of boredom. Love C++, C, JavaScript, Vue, React, Node JS, Python, PHP, HTML5 & CSS3, SCSS, Git, GitHub and etc.

## Now a little bit about me.

I've been programming since I was 14. Developed websites: layout, design layouts for them. Now I am fond of C++ and a little passionate about developing plugins for the game Gta San Andreas. It also requires reverse engineering, which is what I'm doing now. I'm studying it. Also, don't make fun of repositories. I understand my repositories are a joke. I posted them for the sake of the test, because I'm afraid to put my work on public display. I'm trying to fight it! Look forward to incredibly cool projects in the future!
